### Current Items

1.  **File:** `frontend/src/components/MessageBubble.tsx`
    *   **Line:** 34
    *   **Comment:** `// TODO: Implement delete draft functionality`
    *   **Context:** The `MessageBubble` component, which is responsible for rendering individual chat messages, has a placeholder comment indicating that the functionality for deleting an email draft has not yet been implemented.
    *   **Action Required:** A developer needs to add a "Delete" button to the draft view and wire it up to an API endpoint that can delete the draft.


2.  **File:** `frontend/src/components/Directory.tsx`
    *   **Line:** 211
    *   **Comment:** `// TODO: Implement drag-and-drop functionality for moving files and folders`
    *   **Context:** The `Directory` component, which provides a file-system-like interface, currently relies on a "cut" and "paste" workflow for moving items.
    *   **Action Required:** To improve the user experience, a developer should implement a drag-and-drop interface. This would involve using a library like `react-dnd` to allow users to visually drag files or folders and drop them into a new parent directory.


3.  **File:** `backend/src/routes/gemini.ts`
    *   **Line:** 12
    *   **Comment:** `// TODO: Add proper error handling and logging`
    *   **Context:** The general Gemini chat route (`/api/gemini/chat`) has minimal error handling. If the call to the Google Generative AI API fails, it will likely crash the request without providing a clear error message to the user or logging the issue for debugging.
    *   **Action Required:** A developer needs to wrap the API call in a `try...catch` block. In the `catch` block, the error should be logged to the console (or a proper logging service), and a standardized JSON error response should be sent to the frontend with a user-friendly message.
