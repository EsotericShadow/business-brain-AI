# Solution: Correctly Load Environment Variables

The server is crashing because it cannot find the `.env` file. The `package.json` file confirms the backend is run from the `/backend` directory, which is where the `.env` file is located.

The solution is to simplify the `dotenv` configuration in `backend/src/index.ts` to its most basic form, which correctly loads the file from the current directory, and to remove all previous, incorrect attempts.

## Proposed Code Change

I will replace the entire faulty block related to `dotenv` in `backend/src/index.ts` with a single, correct line.

**This is the code block that needs to be replaced:**

```typescript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

// Load environment variables from .env file
dotenv.config({ path: '.env' });
```

*(Note: The above block contains a duplicate import and was the result of a faulty replacement in a previous step.)*

**This is the single line of code that will replace it:**

```typescript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();
```

This change will:
1.  Remove the incorrect and conflicting code.
2.  Use the standard `dotenv.config()` call, which correctly loads the `.env` file from the current working directory (`/backend`).
3.  Resolve the `Missing critical environment variables` error and allow the server to start.

This is the standard and most reliable way to use the `dotenv` library and should permanently fix the startup crash.
