# Bug Report: Backend Server Fails to Start

## 1. Summary

The backend server consistently crashes on startup, preventing the frontend from connecting and making the application unusable. The core issue is a failure to load critical environment variables from the `.env` file.

## 2. Error Log

The following errors are consistently reported in the terminal when attempting to start the backend server:

```
ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined in ES module scope
    at file:///Users/main/Desktop/business-brain-ai-assistant 2/backend/src/index.ts:19:36

Error: Missing critical environment variables. Check your .env file.
    at file:///Users/main/Desktop/business-brain-ai-assistant 2/backend/src/index.ts:34:9
```

This leads to a connection error on the frontend:

```
proxy error AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]
```

## 3. Analysis of Failures

My previous attempts to fix this issue were unsuccessful due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the project's configuration.

*   **Attempt 1: Incorrect Path (`../.env`)**: I incorrectly assumed the script's working directory was `src`, leading me to use a relative path that was invalid.
*   **Attempt 2: Using `__dirname`**: I tried to dynamically create an absolute path using `__dirname`, but this variable is not available in the ES Module scope your project uses, which caused the `ReferenceError`.
*   **Attempt 3: Simplistic `dotenv.config()`**: My final attempt to simplify the call failed because I did not correctly identify and resolve the conflicting code that was already in the file.

The root cause is a combination of an incorrect path to the `.env` file and improper handling of ES module pathing conventions.

## 4. Current State

The server is unstartable, and the application is therefore non-functional. The problem lies entirely within the environment variable loading section of `backend/src/index.ts`.
