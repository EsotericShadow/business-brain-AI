# HTML Sanitization Implementation

This document shows the change made to `frontend/src/components/EmailView.tsx` to sanitize the email body before rendering.

## Modified Code

The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop in the `EmailDetail` component was modified to use `DOMPurify.sanitize()`.

### Before:

```jsx
<div 
  className="email-body-content flex-1 p-4 md:p-6 overflow-y-auto text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed" 
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: email.body }}
>
</div>
```

### After:

```jsx
<div 
  className="email-body-content flex-1 p-4 md:p-6 overflow-y-auto text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed" 
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(email.body) }}
>
</div>
```
